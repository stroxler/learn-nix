# Learn-nix: following along with some tutorials

Tutorials and order

I've got inline notes about how I understood each component
of each tutorial, and as far as I know there are no mistakes
per se but many of them are hand-wavey and not using the right
vocab because I didn't go back and edit as my understanding
evolved.
